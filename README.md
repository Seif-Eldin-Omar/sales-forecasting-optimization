## Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Collection, Exploration, and Preprocessing
**Objectives:**
- Collect historical sales data with features such as date, promotions, holidays, and weather.
- Explore the dataset to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- Preprocess the data for modeling.

**Tasks:**
- Acquire a reliable historical dataset.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Clean the data: handle missing values, remove duplicates, normalize.
- Engineer time-based features (e.g., day of week, season, holiday flags).

**Deliverables:**
- EDA notebook with visualizations.
- Cleaned dataset ready for modeling.
- Summary report of trends and insights.

### Milestone 2: Data Analysis and Visualization
**Objectives:**
- Further clean and analyze the dataset.
- Visualize relationships and seasonal patterns.

**Tasks:**
- Analyze correlations between sales and other variables.
- Identify seasonal trends, promotions, holiday effects.
- Create interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned dataset with refined features.
- Analysis report describing key drivers of sales.
- Visualizations and interactive dashboards for exploration.

### Milestone 3: Forecasting Model Development and Optimization
**Objectives:**
- Build forecasting models and optimize their performance.

**Tasks:**
- Select models (ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM).
- Train models using time-series validation techniques.
- Evaluate performance using RMSE, MAE, MAPE.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Select the best-performing model based on metrics.

**Deliverables:**
- Forecasting model code and training scripts.
- Model performance report.
- Final model saved for deployment.

### Milestone 4: MLOps, Deployment, and Monitoring
**Objectives:**
- Implement MLOps practices and deploy the model for real-time or batch predictions.

**Tasks:**

**1. MLOps Implementation:**
- Use MLflow to log metrics, parameters, and artifacts.
- Use DVC to version datasets and models.

**2. Deployment:**
- Build a user interface with Flask or Streamlit for predictions.
- Deploy locally or on a cloud platform (Heroku, GCP, AWS).
- Ensure support for real-time or batch inputs.

**3. Monitoring:**
- Track model performance over time.
- Detect drift or performance degradation.
- Implement a feedback loop for retraining.

**4. Performance Reporting:**
- Log metrics to dashboards.
- Set up alerts when performance falls below acceptable thresholds.

**Deliverables:**
- Deployed web app for generating forecasts.
- MLOps pipeline documentation.
- Monitoring setup documentation and alerting system.

### Milestone 5: Final Documentation and Presentation
**Objectives:**
- Document the complete project and communicate results to stakeholders.

**Tasks:**
- Write a detailed project report summarizing all steps, models, and outcomes.
- Prepare a concise presentation highlighting business value, insights, and technical methodology.
- Describe challenges faced and how they were addressed.

**Deliverables:**
- Final project report (PDF or Markdown).
- Slide deck for presentation.
